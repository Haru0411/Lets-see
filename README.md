## ðŸ“– Description

AskHerOut.js is a simple JavaScript app that adds a creative twist to asking a girl out. Instead of a direct approach, the app engages her in a fun game, allowing for a memorable and unique experience.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with AskHerOut.js, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koushith/AskHerOut.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

3. Answer the question prompted by the app.

4. See the result and find out if she said yes! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

The app uses a simple JavaScript function to ask a question using the `prompt` function. Based on the answer provided, it displays a corresponding message using `console.log`. The messages can be customized to suit your style and personality.

## ðŸŽˆ Customization

Feel free to customize AskHerOut.js to make it even more special:

- Edit the prompt question and messages in the JavaScript code to add your personal touch.
